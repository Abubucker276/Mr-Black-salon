  "summary": "Updated service data to include an `image` field for each listed service item, using `/assets/generated/*.dim_800x600.jpg` paths. However, the diff does not add the required new image asset files under `frontend/public/assets/generated`, and there is no diff evidence that the Services page now renders an image for every ServiceCard (REQ-14 AC).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Add new premium, consistent-style service images as static assets under frontend/public/assets/generated and reference them from the corresponding services in frontend/src/data/services.ts.",
      "reason": "No new files were added; the diff explicitly shows `Added: 0` and no assets under `frontend/public/assets/generated`, so the required image filenames cannot be verified as present.",

      "requirement": "The Services page (frontend/src/pages/ServicesPage.tsx) renders an image for every ServiceCard; there are no service cards without an image on the page.",
      "reason": "No changes to `frontend/src/pages/ServicesPage.tsx` or `frontend/src/components/ServiceCard.tsx` are included in the diff summary, so there is no direct evidence that image rendering is enforced for every card (vs. still being optional).",
